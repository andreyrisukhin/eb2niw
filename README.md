# PDF -> evidence -> PDF
This repository contains a Python script, and its utilities, to 
1) Process an anonymized personal statement, in pdf format.
2) Collect evidence across the internet.
3) For each personal statement, your python script should output well formatted pdf documents listing all supporting evidence and arguments for eligibility criterion #1 listed above.

## Criteria #1

B. Eligibility for National Interest Waiver

Prong 1: Evidence That Your Endeavor Has Substantial Merit and National Importance

    Provide a detailed description explaining your proposed endeavor and supporting documentary evidence to establish that the endeavor is of national importance.
        The term “endeavor” is more specific than the general occupation; you should offer details not only as to what the occupation normally involves, but what types of work you propose to undertake specifically within that occupation.
        When explaining the endeavor, you should do so in a straightforward manner, and clearly lay out the potential direct impacts of the endeavor and whether the endeavor will be furthered through the course of your duties at a particular employer or some other way.

Note that benefits to a specific employer alone, even an employer with a national footprint, are not sufficiently relevant to the question of whether your endeavor has national importance. At issue is whether you can demonstrate that your own individual endeavor stands to have broader implications, such as for a field, a region, or the public at large.

Examples from the Policy Manual:

    * While engineer is an occupation, the explanation of the proposed endeavor should describe the specific projects and goals, and the area of engineering in which the person will work, rather than simply listing the duties and responsibilities of an engineer.
        * A proposed endeavor to engage in classroom teaching, without broader implications for a field or region, generally does not rise to the level of having national importance for the purpose of establishing eligibility for a national interest waiver. Citing the general importance of the profession of classroom teaching would not alone be sufficient to demonstrate national importance in the context of a national interest waiver request.
        Proposing to work in an occupation with a national shortage or serve in a consulting capacity for others seeking to work in an occupation with a national shortage alone, is also insufficient.
        * A person developing a drug for a pharmaceutical company may establish national importance by demonstrating the prospective public health benefits of the drug, instead of solely projecting the profits that will accrue to the employer.
        * A person developing a particular technology for use or sale by a given company may not be able to establish national importance based on evidence that this technology will have benefits for the company or its clients alone. To establish broader public or commercial implications at a level consistent with national importance for this field or industry, the petitioner could demonstrate, through the submission of relevant evidence, widespread interest in adoption or licensing of the technology, a novel and important manufacturing or operational process, or how the technology stands to impact the development of similar technology by other companies.
        * A software engineer adapting their employer’s code for various clients will have difficulty demonstrating the national importance of that endeavor, absent additional broader impacts supported by specific evidence.
        * An entrepreneur cannot demonstrate national importance solely by opening a consulting firm for those working or seeking to work in a nationally important occupation. Similarly, statements and evidence regarding the importance of the relevant industry overall, such as the car dealership industry, will not demonstrate that a person seeking to start a car dealership satisfies the national importance prong.
